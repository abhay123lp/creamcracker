=== Test 1 ===
Using word: websit

Modification: for perl screen output functions were disabled

Configuration: lowercase alphabet, minimum size: 6, maximum size 6

  * perl md5cracking - *1540 seconds*
  * krhash 0.3 - *75 seconds*
  * creamcracker md5decode - *0.68 second*


=== Test 2 ===
I found this article about benchmarks:
http://3.14.by/en/read/md5_benchmark

According to it, the fastest cracker is "Barswf"

I generated the hash for word websit:
 * Barswf *3.35* seconds
 * creamcracker *0.68* seconds


It needs more test, because enumeration can produce false effect of speed

obs: Barswf do not have source code available
